    <h2>About SASS</h2>

    <p>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a
      preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance
      and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again. The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal.</p>
      <p>
      Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file
      to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would
      take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.</p>
